    <p>Hi, I'm Taylor Denise Perry and I am an apsiring Web Designer. While in college at Clemson University, I took a course in Web Development and Design. I realized front-end developement was where I wanted to build my career but it called for skills I was not proficient in.
    </p>
    <p>
    As my major was Graphic Communications it was the perfect blend of art/design and coding. In the Web Design Course at Startup Institute it also has the perfect blend of design with the UX/UI and coding with HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am passionate about building beautiful, engaging, interactive websites. I want to learn as much as I can. I put forth my best effort in everything that I do. With front-end development I have found that I could create for hours on end. I am excited for the future of technology and look forward to being a part of creating and designing it.
